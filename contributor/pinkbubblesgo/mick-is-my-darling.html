                He adjusts his blue bell pants and checks himself in the bathroom
                mirror. <i>Great</i>, he thinks with a rehearsed smile. The
                shoulder-length wavy hair, the open shirt, everything is ready for the
                show. He looks at the setlist pasted to the wall one last time:
                everything from the blues years to the Bigger Bang era. <i>Nice</i>.

                What she doesn't know is that this is his last show. It has been five years with The Wild Horses,
                five years of playing at the Wino's, at weddings, small clubs, birthday parties; and he is fed up with
                it. He performs, <i>acts</i>, plays the part to a T, but after the shows are over, he wants nothing to
                do with the part. The girls, specially; God, he can’t stand being <i>adored</i> and stalked like that. He's
                more like Charlie Watts in that sense, low-key and mild-mannered, and for the past years he has
                wished he'd look like Charlie instead so he could blend in behind the drums. He curses his parents
                for giving him the Jagger looks but not so much for the Wino's bar, which he inherited and is his
                only source of income.

                I cannot live with You –<br />
                It would be Life –<br />
                And Life is over there –<br />
                Behind the Shelf<br />
                <br />
                The Sexton keeps the Key to –<br />
                Putting up<br />
                Our Life – His Porcelain –<br />
                Like a Cup –<br />
                <br />
                Discarded of the Housewife –<br />
                Quaint – or Broke –<br />
                A newer Sevres pleases –<br />
                Old Ones crack –<br />
                <br />
                I could not die – with You – <br />
                For One must wait<br />
                To shut the Other’s Gaze down – <br />
                You – could not – <br />
                <br />
                And I – could I stand by<br />
                And see You – freeze – <br />
                Without my Right of Frost –<br />
                Death's privilege?<br />
                <br />
                Nor could I rise – with You – <br />
                Because Your Face<br />
                Would put out Jesus’ – <br />
                That New Grace<br />
                <br />
                Glow plain – and foreign<br />
                On my homesick Eye – <br />

                Shone closer by – <br />
                <br />
                They’d judge Us – How – <br />
                For You – served Heaven – You know,<br />
                Or sought to – <br />
                I could not – <br />
                <br />
                Because You saturated Sight – <br />
                And I had no more Eyes<br />
                For sordid excellence<br />
                As Paradise<br />
                <br />
                And were You lost, I would be – <br />
                Though My Name<br />
                Rang loudest<br />
                On the Heavenly fame – <br />
                <br />
                And were You – saved – <br />
                And I – condemned to be<br />
                Where You were not – <br />
                That self – were Hell to Me –<br />
                <br />
                So We must meet apart – <br />
                You there – I – here – <br />
                With just the Door ajar<br />
                That Oceans are – and Prayer – <br />
                And that White Sustenance – <br />
                Despair – <br />
