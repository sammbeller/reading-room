I've been a flowering tree in the shade
of your leaves, all my branches bare.
My perfume mute, but the scent pervades
Of your nascent fruit in the air.

I've been consumed by that scent, the whispering sound
Of your leaves in the wind has left me unable to speak
I'd bear fruit of my own, now I've found I'm bound
To sing your song instead, but my voice is weak

If I cannot live in the world where shall I live
What thrall am I that has no voice to sing
But in your thrall am compelled to give
My voice to you, my whole self as offering

I pray to breathe out my heart, breathe in the morning dew
And I, empty of myself, make a vessel of myself for you
